conda create -n audiocraft python=3.9
conda activate audiocraft

# Install PyTorch with MPS support (Mac)
pip install torch==2.1.0 torchaudio==2.1.0

# Install AudioCraft
pip install -U audiocraft

# Install additional dependencies
pip install matplotlib jupyter
```

### Testing AudioCraft Installation
```python
# Test script to verify installation and GPU support
import torch
from audiocraft.models import MusicGen

# Check device availability
if torch.backends.mps.is_available():
    device = "mps"
    print("Using MPS (Metal) for generation")
elif torch.cuda.is_available():
    device = "cuda" 
    print("Using CUDA for generation")
else:
    device = "cpu"
    print("Using CPU for generation")

# Load model
model = MusicGen.get_pretrained('small')
model.to(device)
print("Model loaded successfully!")
```

## Testing Notes

- First generation is always slower due to model loading
- Memory usage varies significantly by model size:
  - small: ~2GB VRAM
  - medium: ~4GB VRAM
  - large: ~8GB VRAM
- Expected generation times:
  - CUDA: 5-15 seconds
  - MPS (Metal): 15-45 seconds
  - CPU: 1-5 minutes
