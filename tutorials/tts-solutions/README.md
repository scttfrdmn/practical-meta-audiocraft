# Text-to-Speech Solutions Tutorial

This tutorial covers text-to-speech solutions that can be built using AudioCraft components and related technologies.

## What are TTS Solutions?

Text-to-Speech (TTS) solutions refer to the systems and pipelines that convert written text into natural-sounding spoken audio. While AudioCraft itself is primarily focused on music and sound generation, its components can be integrated with speech synthesis technologies.
