# Practical Meta AudioCraft

This project is a comprehensive book and tutorial collection for Meta's AudioCraft, a powerful AI audio generation framework that can create music, sound effects, and audio using natural language text prompts.

## About Meta AudioCraft

AudioCraft is Meta's foundation research framework for audio generation that enables users to:

- Generate high-quality music from text descriptions
- Create environmental and sound effects
- Produce realistic audio based on text prompts
- Generate speech and voice content
- Build, train and deploy audio generation models
- Create custom audio models and pipelines
