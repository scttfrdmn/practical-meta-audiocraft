# Practical Meta AudioCraft

Welcome to the "Practical Meta AudioCraft" book project! This repository contains a comprehensive book-style guide to using Meta's AudioCraft framework for AI-powered audio generation.

## About the Project

This project transforms the AudioCraft tutorial content into a cohesive, problem-based book following the pedagogical approach used in educational software engineering books. The goal is to create a resource that guides readers from basic concepts to advanced applications with practical, hands-on examples.

## Book Structure

The book is organized into five main parts:

1. **Foundations** - Core concepts and setup
2. **Music Generation with MusicGen** - Creating AI-generated music
3. **Sound Effects with AudioGen** - Generating environmental sounds and effects
4. **Integration and Deployment** - Building applications with AudioCraft
5. **Advanced Applications** - Complex audio generation systems

Each chapter follows a consistent structure:
- Real-world problem scenario
- Step-by-step solution development
- Complete code examples
- Variations and customizations
- Practical exercises

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9 or newer
- PyTorch 2.0.0 or newer
- Basic understanding of Python programming
- Either:
  - CUDA-compatible NVIDIA GPU (for faster generation on Windows/Linux)
  - Apple Silicon Mac with Metal GPU acceleration (M1/M2/M3/M4 series)

### Reading the Book

The book is available in two formats:
1. **Web Version**: Built with Jekyll and available at [URL will be added]
2. **Markdown Files**: Available in the `_chapters` directory of this repository

## Project Status

This project is currently in active development. See the [Project Tracking](PROJECT_TRACKING.md) document for the current status and progress.
