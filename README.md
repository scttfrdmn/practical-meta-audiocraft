AudioCraft is Meta's foundation research framework for audio generation that enables users to:

- Generate high-quality music from text descriptions
- Create environmental and sound effects
- Produce realistic audio based on text prompts
- Generate speech and voice content
- Build, train and deploy audio generation models
- Create custom audio models and pipelines

## Requirements

- Python 3.9 (recommended)
- PyTorch 2.1.0+
- Either:
  - CUDA-compatible NVIDIA GPU (for faster generation on Windows/Linux)
  - Apple Silicon Mac with Metal GPU acceleration (M1/M2/M3/M4 series)
- Basic familiarity with Python and ML frameworks

## Usage

Each tutorial section includes:
- Step-by-step instructions
- Example prompts and configurations
- Best practices and tips
- Sample outputs

## Quick Start

To get started quickly:

```bash
# Install AudioCraft
pip install audiocraft

# Run a simple music generation example
python -c "
import torch
from audiocraft.models import MusicGen
from audiocraft.data.audio import audio_write

# Load model
model = MusicGen.get_pretrained('small')

# Generate music
wav = model.generate(['An upbeat electronic track with a catchy melody'])

# Save output
audio_write('output', wav[0].cpu(), model.sample_rate)
print('Generated audio saved to output.wav')
"
```

For more detailed setup instructions, see our [Getting Started Guide](tutorials/getting-started/README.md).

## Key Features

- [Docker containerization](tutorials/deployment/docker_containerization.md)

## Ethics and Responsible Use

When using AudioCraft or any AI audio generation technology:

- Always attribute generated content as AI-created
- Clearly disclose when music or audio has been AI-generated
- Consider copyright implications of training data and outputs
- Be mindful of potential misuse (voice cloning, misinformation)
- Follow Meta's terms of service and usage guidelines
